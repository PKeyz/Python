Hangman Game

"""
IDEA:::
1.have a list of random words and choose one from the list to play the game
2.hangman ascii art for print / create a list of hangman symbols to iterate over
3.Ask user input for letter 
4.display amount of "_" for len(word)
5 while counter < hangman[]  Guess a letter: if letter in word : show all instances / else: counter +1 , print hangman[counter]
5 if letter in word[] display all letter in another array/string -> 1) array word_hidden -> 2) word_display -> 3)hangman_array
5 when counter == len(hangman) - "Game Over, Try again!"
@each letter toLowerCase() in both word array and input for comparisson
@display 1st letter asCapitalLetter()
@if more than 1 letter input - counter +1, if letter = number - counter +1 
"""

"""
TO-DO'S & BUGS & ADAPTATIONS:::
1.for len(random_array) -> create an array with according length AND each index == index value (e.g [0,1,2,...])
  each time the user makes a right choice and new letters are displayed, the displayed index number is deleted from the starting array.
  the longer the word, the more it makes sense to NOT iterate over the whole word, even when lot's of letters are already found.
  each next time you only check for the remaining closed values and ignore the found ones.
  -> ideally this will reduce the amount of loops
