Do you want to play another game of blackjack? Type 'y' or 'n': 

The dealing of the cards in a game of Blackjack is as follows:

A card is dealt to the player facing upwards (visible to everyone).
The dealer deals a card to himself visible to everyone.
Another card is given to the player facing upwards.
The dealer deals a card facing downwards for himself.
The player has to decide whether to stand with the current set of cards or get another card.
If the player decides to hit, another card is dealt.
If the player decides to stand, then the dealer reveals his hidden card.
The dealer does not have the authority to decide whether to hit or stand. The general rule is that the dealer needs 
to keep hitting more cards if the sum of dealer’s cards is less than 17.

As soon as the sum of dealer’s cards is either 17 or more, the dealer is obliged to stand.
According to the final sum of the cards, the winner is decided.
